After struggling with the module being saved as a json file again, I did a little research and found that this can happen with Jupyter for whatever reason. In my research I found a workaround to this issue where you save the module to a .txt file and call it from there. It got me one step further, and I was able to get the interpreter to recognize my pets.py file, however, now I am having trouble with the actual class within the module being recognized.
