    "At a university, each student is assigned a system login name, which the student uses to log into the campus computer system. As part of your internship with the university’s Information Technology department, you have been asked to write the code that generates system login names for students. You will use the following algorithm to generate a login name:\n",
    "\n",
    "Get the first three characters of the student’s first name. (If the first name is less than three characters in length, use the entire first name.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Get the first three characters of the student’s last name. (If the last name is less than three characters in length, use the entire last name.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Get the last three characters of the student’s ID number. (If the ID number is less than three characters in length, use the entire ID number.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenate the three sets of characters to generate the login name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a student’s name is Amanda Spencer, and her ID number is ENG6721, her login name would be AmaSpe721. You decide to write a function named get_login_name that accepts a student’s first name, last name, and ID number as arguments, and returns the student’s login name as a string. You will save the function in a module named login.py. This module can then be imported into any Python program that needs to generate a login name. Program 8-3 shows the code for the login.py module."
