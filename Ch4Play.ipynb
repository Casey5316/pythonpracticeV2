    "A project currently underway at Chemical Labs, Inc. requires that a substance be continually heated in a vat. A technician must check the substance’s temperature every 15 minutes. If the substance’s temperature does not exceed 102.5 degrees Celsius, then the technician does nothing. However, if the temperature is greater than 102.5 degrees Celsius, the technician must turn down the vat’s thermostat, wait 5 minutes, and check the temperature again. The technician repeats these steps until the temperature does not exceed 102.5 degrees Celsius. The director of engineering has asked you to write a program that guides the technician through this process.\n",
